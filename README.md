# BankSecuritySystem-
A security system built using python, openCV and Microsoft cognitive API.

Liberaries used:
Basic python liberaries,
OpenCV,
Tkinter

#How to run:-
Run main.py and it will provide the GUI for all the modules.  The code can be run separately as well.  Image_Face_Obj_Detection (2).py Runs best on UBUNTU if the main 
Image_Face_Obj_Detection.py (Face and Object detection) code doesn’t work properly.

I am still working on this to improve the UI and the main code.
